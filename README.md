# Great Saunter Map

A simple map app build for participants of [the great saunter](https://shorewalkers.org/great-saunter/), a 32-mile urban hike around the perimeter of Manhattan, NYC.

The app is intended for wayfinding during the event, and includes the route itself along with markers for restrooms, landmarks, and other waypoints.  It is optimized for view on mobile devices and includes a "follow the user" mode that will keep the map centered on the user's location.

## Development

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm deploy`

Builds and eploys the site to github pages using the `gh-pages` npm package
